# The Things Network Arduino Library

[![Slack Status](https://slack.thethingsnetwork.org/badge.svg)](https://slack.thethingsnetwork.org/)

## Introduction

This is an [Arduino Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) for Arduino-compatible devices like [The Things Uno](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-uno/) and [Node](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-node/) to communicate with [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org).

At the moment this library requires devices to feature a [Microchip RN2xx3 module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology).

## Installation

1. Download the source code of the [master](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-library/archive/master.zip) or latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-library/releases) as ZIP file.
2. Follow [Importing a .zip Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4) to install the library using the ZIP file.
3. Restart the Arduino IDE to see the library's examples.

**NOTE:** Examples for the library will not be exposed in the *File > Examples > TheThingsNetwork* until after the IDE has restarted.

## Examples
The library comes with several [examples](examples) that can be found under *File > Eamples > TheThingsNetwork* once you've installed the library and restarted the IDE.

## API

TheThingsNetwork class features the following [public methods](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-library/blob/master/src/TheThingsNetwork.h#L39):

```C++
  public:
    int downlinkPort;
    byte downlink[64];
    void init(Stream& modemStream, Stream& debugStream);
    void reset(bool adr = true, int sf = DEFAULT_SF, int fsb = DEFAULT_FSB);
    bool personalize(const byte devAddr[4], const byte nwkSKey[16], const byte appSKey[16]);
    bool join(const byte appEui[8], const byte appKey[16]);
    int sendBytes(const byte* buffer, int length, int port = 1, bool confirm = false);
    void showStatus();
```
