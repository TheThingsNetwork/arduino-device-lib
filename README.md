# The Things Network Arduino Library

This is an [Arduino Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) for Arduino-compatible devices like [The Things Uno](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-uno/) and [Node](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-node/) to communicate via [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org).

At the moment this library requires devices to feature a [Microchip RN2xx3 module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology).

## Installation

Install the library by [Using the Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3) or by [Importing the .zip library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4) using either the [master](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-device-lib/archive/master.zip) or one of the [releases](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-device-lib/releases).

## Documentation

A Quick Start and full API Reference can be found in [The Things Network Documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/arduino/).
