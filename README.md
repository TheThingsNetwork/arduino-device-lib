# The Things Network Arduino Library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-device-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheThingsNetwork/arduino-device-lib)

This is an [Arduino Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) for Arduino-compatible devices like [The Things Uno](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-uno/) and [Node](https://shop.thethingsnetwork.com/index.php/product/the-things-node/) to communicate via [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org).

> At the moment this library requires devices to feature a [Microchip RN2xx3 module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology).

## Installation

* Install the library by [Using the Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3)
